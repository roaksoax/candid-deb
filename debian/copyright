Comment:
 The blues-identity source package includes a number of other
 upstream projects in addition to blues-identity itself.
 .
 This reflects the static linking approach taken in Go as
 all dependencies are linked in at build time.
 .
 To ease audits and updates of this file, please maintain each upstream
 project's copyright information in its own separate Files section in
 alphabetical order of upstream project, so that the data for each
 upstream project is close together and complete by itself. If an
 upstream project needs multiple Files sections for its copyright
 description, then please bundle these together in the same section for
 that upstream project. So collapsing License sections together across
 this file is fine, but please do not collapse Files sections across
 multiple upstream projects, since this causes difficulty when updating
 this file after individual upstreams change.
 .
 Licenses that use template replacements may be duplicated in this
 file, since different files have different template replacements, and
 the licenses require that the original text be reproduced. This means
 that the standard short names cannot be used, since then the text would
 have to be the same. Instead, this file uses names like
 BSD-2-clause+Apple and BSD-3-clause+Google to try and retain the intent
 of dep5 as closely as possible without making it too difficult to keep
 this file maintained. This use does not appear to be in violation of
 dep5.
